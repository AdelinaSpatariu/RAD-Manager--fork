# Easily configure Relational Anomaly Detection and inspect its results

[Relational Anomaly Detection (RAD)](https://aka.dataminer.services/RAD) is a **powerful feature** that can detect when a group of parameters **deviates from its normal behavior**. It can be used **in many different scenarios** such as monitoring whether main and backup channels are in sync, checking whether load balancing is performing optimally, tracking health of battery cells and many more.
